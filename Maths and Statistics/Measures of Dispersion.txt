The mean is the value usually used to indicate the centre of a distribution. If we are dealing with quantity variables our description of the data will not be complete without a measure of the extent to which the observed values are spread out from the average.

We will consider several measures of dispersion.

During this project we will introduce this concepts and practice using real dataset.

Measure of Dispersion
Range
One very simple measure of dispersion is the range. Range is a measure of dispersion that calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.

Lets consider the two distributions given in the following Figures. They represent the marks of a group of thirty students on two tests.

import numpy as np
from scipy import stats


test_a=np.random.randint(low=40, high=70, size=(20))
test_b=np.append(np.random.randint(low=50, high=70, size=(20)),20)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.hist(test_b)
ax.hist(test_a)
ax.set_xlabel('x')
ax.set_ylabel('frequency')
ax.set_title('Histogram')
ax.legend(loc='best', frameon=True)
ax.grid(True)

Preview
On test A, the range is 
70
−
40
=
30
.

On test B, the range is 
70
−
20
=
50
 but apart from the outliers, the distribution of marks on test B is clearly less spread out than that of A.

Range has several limitations, fo example it is sensitive to outliers, does not consider the variability between the maximum and minimum values, and may not be representative of the population if the sample size is small. Additionally, range does not provide information on the shape of the distribution and can be affected by the scale of the data, which can make it a poor measure for comparing datasets.

Mean Deviation
Mean deviation, also known as the average deviation, is a measure of dispersion that quantifies the average distance between each data point and the mean of the dataset.

It is calculated by taking the absolute value of the difference between each data point and the mean, summing those values, and dividing by the number of data points.

It is useful in situations where the mean is a good representative of the central tendency of the dataset, but where the researcher also wants to capture information about the spread of the data. However, mean deviation is less commonly used than other measures of dispersion, such as the standard deviation or interquartile range, because it has some mathematical properties that make it more difficult to work with.

The formula of the mean deviation is:


Preview
where the numerator is now the sum ofthe absolute values of the deviations, and absolute values are always positive in sign.

There is a comparable mean deviation formula for populations


Preview
Variance
The variance (or mean squared deviation, or mean sum of squares) of a population is the arithmetic mean of its squared deviations from the population mean.

It is therefore defined by this definitional formula for the population variance.

For a sample,

The numerator is, as you would expect, the sample sum of square. But while the denominator of the population variance is N, population size , here the denominator is n - 1 , sample size minus one. The denominator 
n

 is Bessel’s correction.

Let's code a function to compute the variance:

def variance(data):
     # Number of observations
    n = len(data)
     # Mean of the data
    mean = sum(data) / n
    # Square deviations
    deviations = [(x - mean) ** 2 for x in data]
     # Variance
    variance = sum(deviations) / n
    return variance
Standard Deviation
The variance has two important limitations:

While the units for the variance are the original measurement units squared, an ideal measure of dispersion from the mean would have the same original units as the mean,

The variance is too sensitive to extreme values in the data, since it involves squared quantities.

The solution to both of these limitations is to take the positive square root of the variance. This quantity, called the standard deviation

The population standard deviation:


Preview
For a sample,


Preview
Both the population and the sample standard deviations are always positive values because they are defined as the positive square roots (or principal square roots of their variances.

Let's code a function to compute the standard deviation:

def stdev(data):
    var = variance(data)
    std_dev = (var)**0.5
    return std_dev
To compute the variance and the standard deviation you could use numpy and pandas.

you can use the numpy.var() function to calculate the variance and the numpy.std() function to calculate the standard deviation.

you can use the pandas.DataFrame.var() function to calculate the variance and the pandas.DataFrame.std() function to calculate the standard deviation.

For the following dataset determine the variance and standard deviation of the Age and Rating.

import pandas as pd

#Create a Dictionary of series
d = {'Name':pd.Series(['Emma','James','Ricky','Vera','Steve','Smith','Jack',
   'Eva','Chanchal','Gasper','Maria','Andrew']),
   'Age':pd.Series([19,26,25,33,30,29,23,34,40,55,25,46]),
   'Rating':pd.Series([4.29,3.24,3.98,3.56,1.20,2.66,3.8,3.78,2.98,4.80,4.10,3.65])}

#Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(d)

STD : Age = 10.405 and Rating = 0.926


VAR : Age = 8.265 and Rating = 1.345


VAR : Age = 108.265 and Rating = 0.857


STD : Age = 11.402 and Rating = 0.996

Correct
# Calculate the standard deviation
print ('STD for Age:',df['Age'].std())
print ('STD for Rating:',df['Rating'].std())

# Calculate the variance
print('VAR for Age:',df['Age'].var())
print('VAR for Rating:',df['Rating'].var())

Computing the variance for the Datasaurus Dozen Dataset

The "Datasaurus Dozen" dataset contains 13 datasets, each with a different shape but the same summary statistics. Import the datasaurus.csv using pandas as df.

Once you have imported the dataset, you can compute the variance for each dataset.

What happens to a variance or standard deviation when a constant is added? What if the variance and standard deviation is multiplied by a constant.


Variability increase when a constant is added but multiplying by a constant changes the variability.


Variability decrease when a constant is added but multiplying by a constant changes the variability.


Variability stays the same when a constant is added but multiplying by a constant changes the variability.
